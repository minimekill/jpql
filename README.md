Object relational mapping is an effective way of storing objects in into database tables. it works as a bridge between objects from the facade to the DB

It reduces the amount of written code, no low lvl JDBC or sql code
creates distance to database and schema by being able to control it in a java enviroment.

Before we converted objects into strings ints or booleans to make it fit in a database, or the other way around, no more translating!


All findings can be found in the "populate" class!
